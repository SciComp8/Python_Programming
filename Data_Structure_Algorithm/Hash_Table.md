- A data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs
- Almost every programming language has a built-in hash table: hashes, hash maps, dictionaries (python), associative arrays
- In a hash table, each position is a slot or bucket
- Every time a hash function is applied, it must return the same value for the same input
