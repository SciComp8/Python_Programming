## Merge sort algorithm
- Merge sort adheres to the divide and conquer approach, which involves breaking the task down into several distinct phases.
  - It begins with the **Divide** phase, where the problem is divided into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
  - Next, during the **Conquer** phase, these sub-problems are solved recursively.
  - Finally, in the **Combine** phase, the solutions to these sub-problems are integrated to obtain the ultimate solution.
