## Tree/graph traversal
- Traversal involves exploring every node in a tree or graph, and this can be achieved using depth-first search or breadth-first search methods. These techniques are applicable to both binary trees and graphs.
- Three methods exist for traversing a binary tree with depth-first search: in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal.
- In-order traversal: traverse the left subtree of the current node, followed by the current node, and finally,the right subtree.
