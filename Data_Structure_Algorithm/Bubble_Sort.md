## Bubble sorting algorithms
- Sorting algorithms are crucial because they can reduce the complexity of problems.
- Bubble sorting algorithm examines and exchanges two neighboring elements until they are arranged correctly.
- Process:
  - Initial iteration: begin with the first index and compare it with the second element. If the first element is larger than the second, swap them. Continue this process for the second and third elements, swapping if necessary. Repeat these steps until reaching the last element.
  - Subsequent iterations: repeat the same process for the remaining iterations. After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted ones is moved to the end. During each iteration, comparisons are made up to the last unsorted element. The array is considered sorted when all unsorted elements are in their correct positions.
