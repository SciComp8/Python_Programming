- A graph is a data structure formed by a set of nodes (vertices)
- Nodes are connected by links (edges)
- Trees are a type of graph
- Directed and undirected graphs: the relationship between 2 nodes is mutual
- Weighted graphs: numeric values associated with the edges; can be directed or undirected
- Tree vs graph:
  - Trees cannot have cycles: each node cannot reference each other circularly
  - Trees require that all nodes must be connected
- Real application: 1) social networks; 2) drug-drug interaction; 3) location and distance; 4) graph database; 5) search and sort algorithm
