## Procedural programming
- We treat codes asn a sequence of steps
- It is suitable for data analysis and scripts

## Object-oriented programming
- We treat codes as interactions of objects
- It is suitable for building frameworks and tools (e.g., application program interfaces, graphical user interfaces, pandas DataFrames)
- Better organize our codes, making them more resuable and maintainable
