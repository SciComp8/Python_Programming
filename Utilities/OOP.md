## Procedural programming
- We treat codes asn a sequence of steps
- It is suitable for data analysis and scripts

## Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- We treat codes as interactions of objects
- It is suitable for building frameworks and tools (e.g., application program interfaces, graphical user interfaces, pandas DataFrames)
- Better organize our codes, making them more resuable and maintainable

## Object
```
object = attributes/variables + methods/functions
```
Encapsulation is a distinctive feature of OOP, which bundles the attributes with the methods operating on them
The object is a realization of a class with particular attribute values
In python, everything is an object, even a function

## Class
It is a blueprint for objects, outlining possible attributs and methods
In python, everything has a class
```
# Find the class of an object
type(obj)
```
