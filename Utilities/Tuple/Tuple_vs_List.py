# Tuples and lists hold the data in the order
# We can access elements inside a tuple or a list with an index
# We can use the unpacking to expand a tuple or a list into named variables that represent each element in a tuple or a list

# Unlike lists, elements in the tuples are immutable -> ensure our data is not altered
# Tuples are easier to process and more memory efficient than lists
