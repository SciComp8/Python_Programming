When we use `X_cat_train_full[col]`, we get a Series corresponding to that column.

when we use `X_cat_train_full[[col]]`, we get a DataFrame with just that single column.

A DataFrame allows us to maintain the structure (e.g., number of columns) for consistency with other DataFrame operations, while a one-dimensional Series might behave differently in certain operations.

```python
X_train['var_name'] = pd.DataFrame(imputer_mean.fit_transform(X_train['var_name']), index=X_train.index)

Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
```

The error occurs because the imputer expects a 2D array, but passing a single column with single brackets returns a 1D Series. We can fix this by selecting the column as a DataFrame using double brackets. 

```python
X_train['var_name'] = pd.DataFrame(imputer_mean.fit_transform(X_train[['var_name']]), index=X_train.index)
```

*Note*: when we convert the imputed array to a DataFrame, we need explicitly pass the index that matches the index of `X_train`.
