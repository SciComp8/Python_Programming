## Question 1
pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter / 2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius ** 2

## Question 2
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]

a, b = b, a

## Question 3
(5 - 3) // 2
8 - 3 * 2 - (1 + 1)
# a // b	Floor division: Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts
